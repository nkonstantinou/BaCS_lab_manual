<h2>Setting up a research study<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-a-research-study" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Anyone starting a new research project should follow this approach,
which I’ve adapted from other labs.
The goal is to have a consistent way of doing things in the lab that encourages
open science, collaboration, and me being able to understand your project after you have left the lab.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The main repository.
Have me start a project on Open Science Framework (OSF)
with you as a contributor for your project.
This project should contain a descriptive README.md
file that gives the study back- ground and hypotheses,
a description of all of the 􏰀iles in the reposi- tory,
and links to any relevant 􏰀iles not in the repository.
Basically, with the README.md file, another researcher
should be able to understand and repeat the study.</li>
<li>Data.
The OSF repository should contain the programs used to
collect the data (e.g., EPrime, PsychoPy, etc.),
any raw non-MRI data, processed data used for statistics, etc.</li>
<li>Stimuli.
Stimuli should be uploaded to OSF before data collection starts.
These could be in the main repository, but if they might be used
by another study—which is often the case—they should have their own repository,
and be linked from the lab website.</li>
<li>Statistics.
Scripts for analysis — for example, from R, Matlab, or Jamovi —
Should be in the OSF repository.
Scripts should be written to use the open data as much as possible;
for example, by getting data directly from OSF rather than from
the local disk, or by including code to handle MRI data downloaded
from a shared repository.
Wherever possible scripts should also generate Figures as close
to those in the paper as practical.</li>
<li>Final Figures.
EPS, PDF, and/or PNG images of Final Figures should be in the
repository with an explicit CC-BY creative commons license so that
the Figures can be re-used without charge by us and others (e.g., in review articles).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="participants">
<h2>Participants<a class="headerlink" href="#participants" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Our research is made possible by the goodwill and generosity of our research participants.
We not only need people to participate in our studies, but to try hard to do their best,
and potentially return for a future study.
Caring for our participants is one of the most important parts of the lab and something
in which every member plays a role.</p>
<p>The most important thing is that participants must always be confident that
we are professional and treating them with respect.
All of the specific advice supports these goals.
In general, it is helpful to model our interactions off of other professional situations,
such as a doctor’s office.</p>
<p>For all participants:
• Dress professionally: No pajamas, sports shorts or sandals.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>When in doubt, ask! This is true for both young and older adults —
dressing professionally will help undergraduate participants to take the experiment seriously.</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Answer the phone, and return all phone calls (and emails) promptly.
Tell participants who you are, and where you are calling from:
“Hello, this is [name] calling from the Cyprus University of Technology.
I am returning your call from yesterday regarding a research study.”</li>
<li>Be prepared to answer questions.
If you don’t know the answer, it is completely fine to ask the participant
if someone else can call them back.
You are then responsible for making sure this happens quickly.</li>
<li>Arrive at least 30 minutes prior to testing time to make sure equipment and paperwork are all set,
and to be around in the event the participant shows up early.
Everything should be set up before the participant arrives.
For people coming from off campus,
you should be at the designated meeting spot 15 minutes before the agreed upon time.</li>
<li>Always use a title (Dr./Ms./Mr.) and a participant’s last name when addressing them.
If you aren’t sure how to pronounce their name, ask them.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can also help participants feel more at ease by being thoughtful about the language we use.
For example, participating in a “research study” is more friendly than being a “subject” in an “experiment”.</p>
<p>Some participants are involved in multiple studies, and they may lose track of which person
is associated with which study.
Make sure to remind participants you are calling or emailing where you calling from,
and clarify the location for testing when the time comes.</p>
<p>Refer to the lab wiki for specific information on recruiting, scheduling, and testing participants.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lab-notebook">
<h2>Lab notebook<a class="headerlink" href="#lab-notebook" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Anyone conducting an independent research project should have a lab notebook for keeping track
of discussions, experiments, and taking notes.
You may also want to use an electronic notebook (e.g., Microsoft OneNote, Evernote)
as your primary lab notebook, or to supplement a paper copy.
The important thing is that you are keeping notes, and they are in one place.</p>
