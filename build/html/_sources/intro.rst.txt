Introduction
=============

We are glad that you have joined or are considering to join, the Brain and Cognitive Science (BaCS) Lab, 
at the Rehabilitation Sciences Department of the Cyprus University of Technology . 

Our aim is to create an environment in which we can do good science while we enjoy ourselves 
in a friendly and welcoming environment.

We ask that all lab members read the following documentation carefully 
and contact Nikos or other lab members with any questions.

The following are a set of principles, values, and skills that we aspire to instil in our lab members:

**Scientific Thinking**
------------------------
We seek to develop scientists who are curious and motivated about finding the truth
in any question that concerns them.

**Computing & Equipment**
--------------------------
Most of our work depends on interacting with computers and other lab equipment 
necessary for properly executing and disseminating our science. 
We therefore aim for everyone to invest in becoming proficient with computers, 
computer programming, and technical skills needed.

**Scientific Integrity**
-------------------------
We aim to do high quality science in the field of Cognitive Neuroscience. For this, 
we emphasize practices that ensure reproducibility and replicability of research. 

**Collegiality**
------------------
Science is teamwork. 
We aim to create a supporting and welcoming environment where we enjoy doing science 
and interacting with each other.
