<p>Science is hard. But it’s also fun. In the Lab, we want to make sure that everyone experiences a positive, engaging, hostility-free, challenging, and rewarding lab environment. To maintain that environment, we all have to do a few things.</p>
<p>We expect that each other to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Work hard, get things done, and be proud. Bragging is ok!</p></li>
<li><p>Pay attention to detail. Double check things. Assume that you have made a mistake and try to find it.</p></li>
<li><p>Science is a marathon, not a sprint. Don’t rush things. Take your time to think things over and have a life outside the lab.</p></li>
<li><p>Mistakes are acceptable, of course. When we do mistakes, we admit to them, and we make sure we tell everyone who needs to know, we correct them and move on. We accept mistakes by others. But no scientific misconduct.</p></li>
<li><p>Help others and support those who are struggling. Science is a team effort and humans are social beings, we all stand to benefit from supporting each other.</p></li>
<li><p>Share your knowledge openly. Ask for help when in need. Mentoring is part of doing great science.</p></li>
<li><p>Participate in science communication and dissemination activities of the lab. These include scientific conferences as well as activities for the general public (science festivals, articles in the press, Researcher’s night, etc)</p></li>
<li><p>Respect each other’s strengths, weaknesses, differences, and beliefs. We don’t tolerate discrimination, tension or hostility.</p></li>
<li><p>Invest on statistics and computer skills that are necessary. Matlab, Python, Jamovi, OpenSesame, PsychoPy, OSF, Github are some of the things you should master.</p></li>
<li><p>Be a world expert on the scientific literature of your project. Read one paper everyday and discuss it with other people. We depend on this. This is your priority.</p></li>
<li><p>Plan for the future. One day you will need to leave the lab and be independent. Invest on the skills and social network that will help you do that.</p></li>
<li><p>Be patient with Nikos. He will forget most of the things you discuss. Please send him reminders.</p></li>
<li><p>Have fun. Have a life outside the lab. Take breaks. Have hobbies. Invite me to your outings.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Small Picture<a class="headerlink" href="#small-picture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are a few day-to-day things to keep in mind to keep the lab running smoothly.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If you are not feeling well or fear that you may be ill, please stay home. This is important for you so that you rest and get better but also for not risking everyone else getting ill.</p></li>
<li><p>You are not expected to come into lab on weekends and holidays, and you aren’t expected to stay late at night. You are expected to get your work done (whatever time of day you like to do it, including weekends and holidays).</p></li>
<li><p>Please be on time for meetings, for running participants, and for classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Lock the door of the lab, turn off the air-conditioning and any other equipment you may need to turn off when leaving.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep the lab tidy. Eating in lab is fine, but clean up food waste, crumbs, spills. Put lab equipment back where you found it. Keep common areas uncluttered.</p></li>
<li><p>Please put food trash in another trash can (not in the lab), especially late in the day or on Friday (so that food doesn’t stay in the lab overnight).</p></li>
<li><p>Dress code is casual (and you can dress up if you want!) but not too casual. When interacting with participants or presenting your work, don’t wear pajamas and sweat pants – but jeans are totally fine.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid wearing very strong perfumes/colognes/etc. in the lab (for the sake of your coworkers and our participants).</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="principal-investigator">
<h2>Principal Investigator<a class="headerlink" href="#principal-investigator" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All of the above (everyone), plus you can expect me to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Have a vision of where the lab is going</p></li>
<li><p>Support you (scientifically, emotionally, financially)</p></li>
<li><p>Obtain the necessary funding to support the projects and the people in the lab</p></li>
<li><p>Give you feedback on a timely basis, including feedback on project ideas, conference posters, talks, manuscripts, figures, grants</p></li>
<li><p>Communicate the work of the lab in conferences and to the general public.</p></li>
<li><p>Be available in person and via e-mail on a regular basis (e.g. once a week), including regular meetings to discuss your research (and anything else you’d like to discuss)</p></li>
<li><p>Give my perspective on where the lab is going, where the field is going, and tips about surviving and thriving in academia</p></li>
<li><p>Support your career development by introducing you to other researchers in the field, promoting your work at talks, writing recommendation letters for you, and letting you attend conferences as often as finances permit</p></li>
<li><p>Help you prepare for the next step of your career, whether it’s a post-doc, a faculty job, or a job outside of academia</p></li>
<li><p>Care for your emotional and physical well-being, and prioritize that above all else</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="post-docs">
<h2>Post-Docs<a class="headerlink" href="#post-docs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All of the above (everyone), and you will also be expected to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Develop your own independent line of research</p></li>
<li><p>Take care of all admin work related to your funding project.</p></li>
<li><p>Help train and mentor students in the lab (both undergraduate and graduate) when asked or when appropriate</p></li>
<li><p>Present your work at departmental events, at other labs (if invited), and at conferences</p></li>
<li><p>Apply for grants (e.g., Cy RPF Excellence Hubs/PostDoc etc). It’s in your best interest to get experience writing grants – and if you get them, you’ll be helping out the entire lab as well as yourself (because you’ll free up funds previously allocated to you)</p></li>
<li><p>Apply for jobs (academic or otherwise) when you’re ready. If you think you’d like to leave academia, that’s completely ok – but you should still treat your post-doc seriously, and talk to me about how to best train for a job outside academia</p></li>
<li><p>Challenge me when I’m wrong or when your opinion is different, and treat the rest of the lab to your unique expertise</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="graduate-students">
<h2>Graduate Students:<a class="headerlink" href="#graduate-students" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>During a PhD you will train on (1) thinking like a scientist and (2) a specific set of skills necessary for performing scientific experiments.
All of the above (everyone), and you will also be expected to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Know the literature very well. The best way is to be consistent with your reading (e.g. one paper every morning). You should also consider Google Scholar alerts, email notifications of journal tables of content, and follow scientists in your field on Twitter.</p></li>
<li><p>Invest in statistics and the software you need for performing the analyses. Examples include Matlab, Python, Jamovi, and R.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn how to create and export publication quality graphs. Examples include Adobe Illustrator and Inkscape.</p></li>
<li><p>Invest in software used for creating experiments. This will depend on the type of experiments you run but a good start is OpenSesame and PsychoPy.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop you science communication skills. Throughout your career it will be very important to properly communication your work in conferences (talks and posters) and to the general public (talks and articles).</p></li>
<li><p>Think of your dissertation as a 4-yeal project and approach it as a start-finish date project during which you need to produce three experimental chapters (each one answering an independent but related question), an introduction chapter, and a discussion chapter.</p></li>
<li><p>Help mentor undergraduate and Master’s students in the lab when they need it. Undergraduate and Master’s students can also help you collect data.</p></li>
<li><p>Present your work at departmental events, at other labs (if invited), and at conferences</p></li>
<li><p>Apply for grants (e.g., CY RPF Excellence Hubs). This is one of the skills you need to master for an academic career.</p></li>
<li><p>Apply for fellowships and awards (including travel awards to conferences)</p></li>
<li><p>Think about what you want for your career (academia – research or teaching, industry, science writing, something else), and talk to Nikos about it to make sure you’re getting the training you need for that career</p></li>
<li><p>It is your responsibility to meet all departmental deadlines (e.g., for your exams and thesis) – and make sure your advisor is aware of them!</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritize time for research. Coursework and admin work are important, but ultimately your research gets you your PhD and prepares you for the next stage of your career.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="lab-managers">
<h2>Lab Managers<a class="headerlink" href="#lab-managers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All of the above (everyone), and you will also be expected to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Be available during normal working hours (typically between 9-5 or 10-6)</p></li>
<li><p>Take care of the physical space of the lab and help maintain a professional atmosphere in the lab.</p></li>
<li><p>Be responsible for Bioethics. Apply for Bioethics approval by the CNBC for new projects and maintain protocols and paperwork. Make sure everyone who needs approval is added.</p></li>
<li><p>Support other lab members with access to software and hardware.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintain lab calendar.</p></li>
<li><p>Help resolve any issues that come up (software, hardware, missing equipment, space issues, social issues) and keep the PI up to date with these issues.</p></li>
<li><p>Help new lab members adjust to the lab by answering whatever questions they have that you can answer.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintain and update the lab wiki.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintain lab Microsoft Teams</p></li>

<li><p>Assist lab members with the recruitment and scheduling of participants, including patients.</p></li>
<li><p>Assist lab members with data collection and analysis (behavior, fMRI, and/or patient studies)</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="undergraduate-students">
<h2>Undergraduate Students<a class="headerlink" href="#undergraduate-students" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All of the above, and you will also be expected to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Assist other lab members with data collection and analysis (unless you are working on your own independent project under the mentorship of another lab member, in which case you should work on that)</p></li>
<li><p>Develop your weekly schedule by talking to your graduate student mentor or your post-doc mentor. You should be coming in every week, and scheduling enough time to get your work done</p></li>
<li><p>If you are earning course credit for research, you must also attend lab meetings when your schedule permits, present at one of these lab meetings, and submit a write-up of your research by the end of the semester</p></li>
<li><p>Provide extra support to the lab manager (this may include filing paperwork). If you are in lab and do not have a task to do, you should ask the lab manager or your supervisor whether there is anything you can help out with.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are doing your undergraduate thesis in the lab, you should expect to do two presentations in lab meetings, one prior to data collection and one after you have finished your work. Please talk to Nikos about this.</p></li>
