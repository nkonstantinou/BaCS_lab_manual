General policies

Hours
-----
One of the benefits of working in an academic environment is that work hours are typically more flexible than other jobs. 
However, you should still treat it like a job and aim to work ~8 hours each day (excluding weekends). 
This is the best way to make sure your getting things done. If you are employed for 40 hours a week, 
you should be working 40 hours a week.
 
Even if you find yourself working from home, you should try to show up in the lab (i.e. Rehabilitation Clinic) 
as much as possible. 
This is the best way to learn from others and help/mentor others.
 
Typically, people are more productive when in the lab - less distractions (bed/sofa, fridge, netflix, etc). 
However, the primary concern is to get your job done and if that requires that you spend some time at home 
you should do that. 
If you have no meetings, no participants, and no other obligations that day, it might be a good day to work at home – 
but you can’t do this all the time, and I expect to see everyone in the lab on a regular basis. 
 
The only exception to this is lab managers / research assistants, who must keep more regular hours 
and be in lab 5 days a week (excluding vacations, doctor appointments, family issues, etc). 
I expect lab managers / research assistants to be in for about 8 hours a day, 
starting around 9am or 10am and ending around 5pm or 6pm.
 
If you are a graduate student, I understand that you may have other obligations such as attending classes, 
but you need to show up to the lab on a regular basis when you don’t have those obligations. 
 
In order to encourage lab interaction, we should all try to be in most weekdays during "peak" hours 
(assuming no other obligations) –e.g., between 11am and 4pm. This is not a hard rule, 
you can work at home occasionally and I understand other obligations. 
But keep it in mind.
 
I often work at night and I also like to work during some weekends. 
You don't need to do the same, but this means I will sometimes send emails or messages outside of normal working hours. 
I do not expect you to respond until you are back at work so please ignore these until normal working hours. 
I do not expect there to be cases when I suddenly and urgently need something from you over the weekend 
(e.g., for a grant deadline), but should I anticipate that happening, 
I will bring it up in advance so we can plan accordingly.
All this said, I realize that being told you can ignore my messages might not take away the stress 
of seeing my messages if you check work email or messages in the evenings or on weekends. 
If my off-hours messages are unwelcome and cause distress, please talk to me, 
and I will be better at not bothering you during your time off.

Meetings
--------
Weekly Lab Meetings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Weekly lab meetings are schedule for no more than 1 hour each and are meant to be a forum for lab member 
to present project ideas and/or data to get feedback from the rest of the group.
 
Projects at any level of completion (or even not yet started!) can benefit from being presented. 
These lab meetings can also be used to talk about methods, statistical analyses, new papers, and career development.
 
For paper discussions, everyone must come to lab meeting having read the paper and prepared with comments 
and questions to contribute. Some weeks we may explore a particular issue and have people read different papers – 
in that case, come to lab meeting having read your paper and be prepared to summarize it for the group.
 
Each lab member (RAs, students, post-docs) is expected to present at least once every semester. 
These meetings are informal, and you can do what you wish with your slot – 
just be prepared to contribute something substantive.
 
Lab members are also expected to attend every meeting (obviously, illnesses, doctor appointments, 
family issues, etc are a valid reason for missing a meeting). 
Undergraduate students are encouraged to attend as often as possible (assuming it fits in their course schedule).
 
Occasionally, we may have joint lab meetings with other faculty in the department (e.g. Kambanaros' team) – 
these may be combined with our weekly lab meeting or an additional meeting. 
We will also use lab meetings (or ad-hoc scheduled meetings) to prepare for conference presentations 
and give people feedback on job talks or other external presentations. 
Lab meeting agendas and notes will be kept in the #lab-meetings channel on Teams.
 
In general, the topic of a weekly lab meeting should be arranged one week in advance. 
So, at the end of each lab meeting we decide on the topic of the next week's meeting (presentation, journal club, etc.)


Individual Meetings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At the beginning of each semester, we will set a schedule for weekly meetings. 
Each full-time lab member (RAs, graduate students, post-docs) 
will have a one-hour slot set aside to meet with the PI of the lab (Nikos).
 
If scheduling conflicts arise (e.g., because of travel), we can try to reschedule for another day that week. 
If there is nothing to discuss, feel free to cancel the meeting or just drop by for a brief chat. 
Nikos will meet with undergraduate students at least every other week (or according to need); 
post-docs and graduate students should meet with their undergraduate mentee on a regular basis.


Deadlines
~~~~~~~~~
In academia many things have hard deadlines, others have rolling or soft deadlines. 
If you need something from me that has a hard deadline, please inform me (and anyone else involved) 
as soon as you know the deadline and please send a reminder three weeks before the deadline. 
One exception is conference abstracts/posters or other paper work that won't require a lot of time; 
for these, please send a reminder at least one week before the hard deadline. 
 
Papers is the most important part of our job. First submissions don't have hard deadlines 
and revisions usually have soft deadlines. 
For these, please give as much time as you can, which means at least three weeks for comments on papers. 
Please send reminders if you haven't received a response in two weeks. 
 
Please note that if you don't adhere to these guidelines, 
I may not have the time to meet your deadline (because other people have sent me reminders in time for their deadline). 


Communication
-------------

I am usually busier than I’d like to be, and as a result have less time for talking to folks than I’d like. 
However, you (lab members) are my team and one of the most important parts of my job, 
so you take priority over many things. 
Some general rules of below:

1. Be proactive and tell me what you need and tell me soon. 
   This includes coming to knock on my door even if it seems like you are interrupting, 
   emailing me to set up a time to meet, or catching me before or after lab meetings. 
   In all likelihood I will not check in with you as often as I’d like, 
   so it is up to you to make sure nothing falls through the cracks.
2. During our meetings it’s important that you take notes. 
   At the beginning of every meeting it’s important that you bring us up to speed and introduce the topic.
3. Read all of the lab documentation: this lab manual, the lab wiki, and Teams. 
   You are responsible for knowing what is in each of these places, 
   following the rules and guidelines we have set up, and notifying someone if you find incorrect information 
   (or if you have questions).
4. I can be the most helpful to everyone if you are a little bit strategic in what you ask me. 
   Please check the lab wiki, other people in the lab, and a Google search before shooting me off a question.
5. Metaphorically my door is always open, but sometimes my door is, physically, closed. 
   In this case I am probably working on something that needs my full attention 
   so before knocking on my door please check the lab manual, the lab wiki, ask your labmates, and google before you ask. 

Microsoft Teams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Teams is our primary means of communication in the lab. 
Email is last resort. 
Teams is an application that allows us to communicate through chat instead of email, 
and share files and edit them together at the same time. 
You can create a Teams account using your CUT email. 
You can follow this link for tutorials. 

Please avoid email and use Teams for things such as general lab announcements, 
sharing links, sharing and/or discussing papers, and basically any message that can be sent without email. 

Email
~~~~~
You can’t avoid emails entirely so when necessary you can of course still send emails 
(e.g. forward something that has been sent to you) but please limit those as much as possible. 
I will try to reply to emails when I can but please don’t use it for anything urgent if you can avoid it. 
If you need to reach me urgently you can call my mobile phone or call the lab (where someone can get in touch with me). 

I try to use Teams as much as possible, but sometimes I will need to email you. 
I expect you will read all email sent to you and respond (if a response is needed) within one business day. 

Important, please learn how to use “reply to all”, “to”, “cc”, and “bcc”.

*Reply to all*
**************

We almost NEVER use this option – unless the lab is on fire, 
you have just received an email with lots of recipients and don’t have time to compose a new email. 

Specifically, **do not** reply to all when:

• Only the original sender needs to know your reply
• Your comments will be crucial to know for the original sender and a few other recipients
• Do a normal reply in this case, and then add the select other recipients manually.
  You can copy their addresses from the original email if that helps
• Your message is simple like "Thanks!" or "Me too."
• Thank you notices might be just fine to send, but don't send them to every other recipient. 
  Only the sender really needs to be aware of how you feel about the message, not every other person in the group


“Reply to all” should be reserved for special cases only. 
It should only be used if you need to send the same message to every single recipient in the group. 
Otherwise, if you don't need to do that, you should reply to only the relevant individuals. 
This may be just replying to the sender or using the CC or BCC fields for multiple, specific recipients.

*To:*
*****
You put someone’s email address in the “to:” 
field only when that person needs to act upon your email. 
Otherwise, consider either CC or BCC.

*CC:*
*****
Someone needs to be informed about something and stay in the loop 
but they **don’t need** to act upon it unless they judge they should. 

*BCC:*
******
Stands for, “blind carbon copy”, meaning that each recipient is blind to all other recipients. 
Please consider using BCC more often since it allows for protection of private data 
and also does not allow for “reply to all”. 

Calendars
~~~~~~~~~
The lab uses the following calendars. 
You should always book a room you are using with participants or for meetings.

• TMS lab: used to book the lab space with the TMS equipment. 
• Rehabilitation Clinic: used for booking rooms at the Clinic. Please indicate the room number.
