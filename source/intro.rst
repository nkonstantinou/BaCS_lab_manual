Introduction
=============

We are glad that you have joined or are considering to join, the Brain and Cognitive Science (BaCS) Lab, 
at the Rehabilitation Sciences Department of the Cyprus University of Technology . 

Our aim is to create an environment in which we can do good science while we enjoy ourselves 
in a friendly and welcoming environment.

We ask that all lab members read the following documentation carefully 
and contact Nikos or other lab members with any questions.

The following are a set of principles, values, and skills that we aspire to instil in our lab members:

**Scientific Thinking**
------------------------
We seek to develop scientists who are curious and motivated about finding the truth
in any question that concerns them.

**Dissemination**
------------------------
Communicating our work is essential. Our primary concern is scientific publications and
conference presentations. However, it is also important to disseminate our work to the 
general public, either through articles in the press or through activities is various 
events such as Science Festivals and Science Cafés.

**Funding and Grants**
-----------------------
It is my responsibility to obtain the necessary funds to keep the lab going.
I do this through grant applications most of which are not successful. 
I can use your help on this from time to time (for example, by asking for figures) 
but I will also ask you to write grant proposals if we have an idea and you are eligible.

**Computing & Equipment**
--------------------------
Most of our work depends on interacting with computers and other lab equipment 
necessary for properly executing and disseminating our science. 
We therefore aim for everyone to invest in becoming proficient with computers, 
computer programming, and technical skills needed.

**Scientific Integrity**
-------------------------
We aim to do high quality science in the field of Cognitive Neuroscience. For this, 
we emphasize practices that ensure reproducibility and replicability of research. 

**Collegiality**
------------------
Science is teamwork. 
We aim to create a supporting and welcoming environment where we enjoy doing science 
and interacting with each other.


**Tips on getting started**
----------------------------

It may be a bit daunting to understand how to start to be involved. Here are a few tips:

1. **Understand what being involved entails**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Reading this manual is a great start. 
   You can also visit our website and read the lab wiki.
   You may also want to ask other lab members to have a chat with you about their experiences.

2. **Reading the literature**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Consistently reading the literature is the best way to get started. 
   It is a good habit to try  and read one paper every day.
   You won't find all papers very interesting or relevant, but when you do take notes.

3. **Invest in learning the necessary skills**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   There are many skills that are involved in being a successful member of the lab 
   (note that not all skills are relevant to all roles), and many of them will be very new. 
   You could start by learning the basics of how to create your own experiment in OpenSesame,
   learn the basics of Python or Matlab programming, how to plot figures,  or the basics 
   of doing statistical analyses using Python/Matlab/Jamovi. 
   If you’re stuck on how to go about learning such skills, 
   you can contact Nikos or other lab members.

4. **Propose a discussion for a lab meeting**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Think about a paper you would like to present to us for discussion or
   think about an experiment you want to perform.
   Suggest that we hold a lab meeting on the topic.

5. **Volunteer to be a pilot participant for experiments**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Often people in the lab will be developing their experimental paradigms 
   and would appreciate a naive observer.
   This is a good opportunity to both learn about the ongoing research of the lab 
   and to experience what is like to be a participant in experiments. 
   Of course, there is no obligation to participate in any studies. 


6. **Subscribe journals - Scholar Alerts**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   One way to stay up to date with relevant research is to subscribe to a journal
   mailing list and to also get Google Scholar reminders for phrases or publications
   from relevant labs.


Location
----------
The lab is currenlty located at the ground floor of the Rehabilitation Clinic. 

Access to the building is provided to postdocs, graduate students and lab managers. Please speak to Nikos
if you think you should be getting access with a set of keys and alarm passcodes. 

Parking
~~~~~~~~
There is plenty of room for parking your car on designated areas around the building. 
Please **do not** park on the pedestrian walkway.
