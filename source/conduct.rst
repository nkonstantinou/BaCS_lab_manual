Code of Conduct
===============

Essential Policies
------------------

The lab, and the university, is an environment that must be free of harassment and discrimination. \
All lab members are expected to abide by the Cyprus University of Technology policies on discrimination, \
harassment, and personal data protection. Essential policies of the Cyprus University of Technology can be accessed here. 
 
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, \
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion (or lack of), \
sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, \
harassing photography or recording (please see section below), sustained disruption of talks or other events, \
inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. 
 
Members asked to stop any harassing or discriminating behavior are expected to comply immediately. \
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, \
please contact Nikos immediately. If Nikos is the cause of your concern, \
then please reach out to the department chair or another trusted departmental member who can assist. 
 
We expect all members of the lab and visitors to follow these guidelines at any lab-related event. 

Taking Photos & Videos
----------------------

We respect the privacy and comfort of lab members by only taking photos or video recordings of them \
with their explicit knowledge and consent. \
This is especially important in situations where a lab member would otherwise not be aware of you taking a photo \
and therefore cannot object if they do not want you to – e.g., \
if they are performing an experiment or are being scanned in an MRI. \
To avoid ambiguity about when a lab member is or is not aware of photos being taken, \
we ask that everyone obtain consent from lab members before taking photos or videos and obtain consent again \
before posting any images on social media. \
This is done to respect others’ privacy and acknowledge that people have varying degrees of comfort \
related to being photographed and especially with having those photographs shared on social media.
 
The goal of this is to foster an environment where everyone feels safe to be who they are, \
take risks, and have fun, without worry or self-consciousness. \
If someone wants to be photographed doing something fun or silly in lab events, and consents to be photographed, \
by all means go ahead! Just please respect the privacy of those who do not want that.
 
You cannot photograph your participants during an experiment. \
We do not have Bioethics approval to do this. \
If you would like a photograph of someone demonstrating your experiment, \
ask a lab member if they would feel comfortable being photographed while demonstrating \
what a participant does in an experiment or perform the experiment yourself and ask a lab member to take your photograph.

Scientific Integrity 
--------------------

Research Misconduct
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The lab, and Cyprus University of Technology, is committed to ensuring research integrity, \
and we take a hard line on research misconduct. We will not tolerate fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism. 
 
At some stage of your career you are likely to feel pressure to publish, \
and this pressure might put you in risk of misconduct, such as fabrication, falsification or plagiarism. \
If you are feeling such pressure, reach out to Nikos or other (perhaps more senior) lab members for a discussion. \
We have all been through such phases but at no point can we tolerate misconduct which can risk the integrity of the lab \
and put your career in danger. 

Reproducible Research
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Reproducibility is related but not the same as replicability. \
Reproducibility refers to reproducing the exact same results when running the exact same statistical analysis pipeline \
on the exact same data set. 
 
Failure to reproduce means that there is a mistake somewhere or misconduct. \
We therefore take reproducibility very seriously in order to avoid mistakes and tackle misconduct. 
 
To my experience, the main reason for failing to reproduce is not misconduct but rather failure to \
properly organize the data files and analysis scripts (including version control). \
For results to be reproducible, the analysis pipeline must therefore be well organized, \
well documented and implement version control (i.e. Github).
 
Although these sound trivial steps, you will be surprised to find that (surprise!) \
conducting reproducible research is more difficult than it sounds. \
This is because it requires that you are organized and possess sufficient foresight to document \
each step of your research process. The following steps can improve the reproducibility of your research:

* Follow BIDS data file organization as described in the paper here and on Github here. 
* Take extensive notes on each step of your analysis pipeline. 
  This means writing down how you did things every step of the way (and the order that you did things), 
  from any pre-processing of the data, to running models, to statistical tests.  
  It’s also worth mentioning that you should take detailed notes on your experimental design as well. 
* Your code should be commented and commented clearly. We all know what it’s like to sit down, quickly 
  write a bunch of code to run an analysis without taking time to comment it,
  and then having no idea what we did a few months down the road. 
  Comment your code so that every step is understandable by an outsider.
* You should use version control as implemented by GitHub to keep track of code changes you make 
  and when you made them, as well as sharing code with others. 
  Please go ahead and create a GitHub account if you don't already have one (https:\\github.com).
  Reproducibility is related to replicability, 
  which refers to whether your results can be obtained again with a different data set. 
  That is, if someone ran your study again (with a different group of participants), do they get the same results?
  If someone ran a conceptually similar study, do they get the same results? 
  Science grows and builds on replicable results – one-off findings don’t mean anything.
  Our goal is to produce research that is both reproducible and replicable.

Authorship
~~~~~~~~~~
Like most labs in the field, we will follow the APA guidelines with respect to authorship here:
 
    *Authorship credit should reflect the individual's contribution to the study. \
    An author is considered anyone involved with initial research design, data collection and analysis,\
    manuscript drafting, and final approval. However, the following do not necessarily qualify for authorship: \ 
    providing funding or resources, mentorship, or contributing research but not helping with the publication \ 
    itself. The primary author assumes responsibility for the publication, making sure that the data are accurate, \
    that all deserving authors have been credited, that all authors have given their approval to the final draft; \ 
    and handles responses to inquiries after the manuscript is published.*

Note that “collect data”, “analyze data”, or “fund the study” aren’t on the list. 
Those are very important parts of a paper, but do not (on their own) warrant authorship. 
Being an author means understanding the content and being willing to take public 
responsibility for the work: 
a large part of this concerns the theoretical motivation and implications of the research. 
In practice theoretical contributions are most often made through helping with the study design, 
data interpretation, and discussion about a topic. 
 
Every project will have a lead researcher (usually a PhD student or a postdoc). 
This person can expect to be first author on any publications coming out of this project. 
Nikos, as the PI of the lab, will typically be the last (senior) author, 
unless the project is under the guidance of another PI, in which case usually Nikos 
will be second to last and the lead PI will be last. 
Anyone who contributes to the intellectual scientific content and writing of the 
manuscript in a meaningful way can expect to be added as an author. 
All of these issues should and will be discussed openly, 
and you should feel free to bring them up if you are not sure of your authorship status
or want to challenge it. 
 
If you are an undergraduate student, a master’s student, or a research assistant 
you can still be an author on a paper. However, you will need to know enough (or learn enough) 
about the project's subject to understand what we’ve done, and to significantly contribute to the writing. 
I won’t add you to a paper just because I like you and want to help you out; 
I will consider giving you the opportunity to be involved to a degree that you have earned authorship, 
if you are willing to take on the challenge. 
 
It is worth pointing out that there are many views regarding authorship, 
and within any view there are always borderline cases. 
When collaborating with other people, we tend to defer to their own lab culture. 
However, it’s important that within our own lab, we are clear on the expectations 
for authorship and transparent about authorship discussions and decisions. 
If you ever have any questions, please come speak to me.

Old projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If a student or post-doc collects a dataset but does not completely analyze it or write it up within 3 years\
after the end of data collection, \
I will re-assign the project (if appropriate) to another person to expedite publication. \
If a student or post-doc voluntarily relinquishes their rights to the project prior to the 3-year window, \
I will also re-assign the project to another individual. \
This policy is here to prevent data (especially expensive data, e.g., fMRI) from remaining unpublished, \
but is meant to give priority to the person who collected the data initially.

Human Subjects Research - Bioethics
-----------------------------------

Adherence protocols approved by the Cyprus National Bioethics Committee (CNBC) is essential, \
and non-adherence can lead to severe consequences for the entire lab \
(i.e., we may lose permission to run any research on human participants). \
All lab members must read and comply with the specific approved consent form and research summary for any project \
that they are working on. If your name is not included in the application, \
you cannot run participants, look at the data, analyze the data, or be in any way involved with the project. \
Please talk to Nikos if you need to be added on one of the projects or need to apply to CNBC for a new project \
(please refer to the wiki for specifics).
  
If a participant falls ill, becomes upset, has an accident with lab equipment, \
or experiences any problems while you are conducting your research, \
you must notify me and the lab manager as soon as possible. \
We may need to report this information to the CNBC and\or funding agencies.
