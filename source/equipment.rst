Computing and Lab Equipment
=================================

The lab has several important pieces of equipment.
These include
TMS machines and coils,
a tDCS system,
a Visor neuronavigation system,
EEG,
eye-tracker,
and several computers for running experiments and data analysis.

Information on how to use the computers and the lab equipment
can be found in the lab wiki.

Please avoid writing computer passworeds on stickers
and treat computer passwords confidentially.
Try using a software for storing passwords.
I can suggest [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com).

Please always book lab space using the corresponding calendar.
