Setting up a research study
-------------------------------
Anyone starting a new research project should follow this approach,
which I’ve adapted from other labs.
The goal is to have a consistent way of doing things in the lab that encourages
open science, collaboration, and me being able to understand your project
after you have left the lab.

• The main repository of data files.
  Have me start a project on Open Science Framework (OSF)
  with you as a contributor for your project.
  This project should contain a descriptive README.md
  file that gives the study background and hypotheses,
  a description of all of the files in the repository,
  and links to any relevant files not in the repository.
  Using the README.md file, another researcher
  should be able to understand and repeat the study.
• Data.
  The OSF repository should contain the programs used to
  collect the data (e.g., OpenSesame, PsychoPy, etc.),
  any raw non-MRI data, processed data used for statistics, etc.
• Stimuli.
  Stimuli should be uploaded to OSF before data collection starts.
  These could be in the main repository, but if they might be used
  by another study — which is often the case —
  they should have their own repository,
  and be linked from the lab website.
• Statistics.
  Scripts for analysis — for example, from Python, R, Matlab, or Jamovi —
  Should be in the OSF repository.
  Scripts should be written to use the open data as much as possible;
  for example, by getting data directly from OSF rather than from
  the local disk, or by including code to handle MRI data downloaded
  from a shared repository.
  Wherever possible scripts should also generate Figures as close
  to those in the paper as practical.
• Final Figures.
  EPS, PDF, and/or PNG images of Final Figures should be in the
  repository with an explicit
  `CC BY 4.0 creative commons license <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`_
  so that the Figures can be re-used without charge
  by us and others (e.g., in review articles).


Participants
---------------
Our research is made possible by the goodwill
and generosity of our research participants.
We not only need people to participate in our studies,
but to also try hard to do their best while answering questions or
performing in computer-based tasks.
We would also like participants to return for a future study.
Caring for our participants is one of the most important parts
of the lab and something in which every member plays a role.

The most important thing is that participants must always be confident that
we are professional and treating them with respect.
All of the specific advice supports these goals.
In general, it is helpful to model our interactions off
of other professional situations, such as a doctor’s office.

Specific advise for all participants:

* Dress professionally: No pajamas, sports shorts or sandals.
  When in doubt, please ask.
  This is true for both young and older adults —
  dressing professionally will help undergraduate participants
  to take the experiment seriously.
* Answer the phone, and return all phone calls
  (and emails) promptly.
  Tell participants who you are, and where you are calling from:
  “Hello, this is [name] calling from the Cyprus University of Technology.
  I am returning your call from yesterday regarding a research study.”
* Be prepared to answer questions.
  If you don’t know the answer, it is completely fine to ask the participant
  if someone else can call them back.
  You are then responsible for making sure this happens quickly.
* Arrive at least 30 minutes prior to testing time to make sure
  equipment and paperwork are all set,
  and to be around in the event the participant shows up early.
  Everything should be set up before the participant arrives.
* Always use a title (Dr./Ms./Mr.) and a participant’s last name
  when addressing them.
  If you aren’t sure how to pronounce their name, ask them.

We can also help participants feel more at ease by being
thoughtful about the language we use.
For example, participating in a “research study” is more friendly
than being a “subject” in an “experiment”.

Some participants are involved in multiple studies,
and they may lose track of which person
is associated with which study.
Make sure to remind participants you are calling
or emailing where you calling from,
and clarify the location for testing when the time comes.

Refer to the lab wiki for specific information on recruiting,
scheduling, and testing participants.

Lab notebook
-------------
Anyone conducting an independent research project
should have a lab notebook for keeping track
of discussions, experiments, and taking notes.
Consider creating a document that summarizes *every*
decision you make, *why* you made it,
and *who* helped make the decision.
Also, use dates.
You may also want to use an electronic notebook
(e.g., Microsoft OneNote, Evernote)
as your primary lab notebook, or to supplement a paper copy.
The important thing is that you are keeping notes, and they are in one place.
